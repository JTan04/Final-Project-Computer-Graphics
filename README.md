Final Project

For my project I created a game where you shoot targets with a ball. When hit, the targets fracture into 8 different pieces. The files that I handed in cointain the nessecary code for collision detection, parabolic curve, and fracturing. In the recources folder, there is a cracks folder which contains the faces for the skybox.

Execution:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j4
./FinalProject
